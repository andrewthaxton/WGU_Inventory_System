# WGU_Inventory_System
Inventory system created as a school project written in Java.
I created this inventory system as part of a school project to demonstrate basic Java concepts. I wrote this using Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA. When ran, a GUI is dispayed
for the inventory system that can be used to add, remove, and search for parts.
